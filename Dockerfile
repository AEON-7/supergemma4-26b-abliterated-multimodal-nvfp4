# Patch modelopt.py with NVFP4_AWQ support + FP8 NaN scrubbing fix
# Fixes: ModelOpt quantizer bug that produces FP8 E4M3 NaN (0x7F/0xFF)
#        in weight_scale tensors, causing NaN propagation during inference.
# Also adds: NVFP4_AWQ quant_algo support, AWQ pre_quant_scale handling,
#            W4A16 bypass for EMULATION backend (dequant weights only).
